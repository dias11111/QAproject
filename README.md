# QAproject
Why are we doing this?
- so that we get the understanding of HTML/Javascript and implement it in the future.

How I expected the challenge to go.
-I expected the challenge to be difficult because there were lots of requirements.

What went well?
-Designing the table went well because I could use different font and colours.

What didn't go as planned?
-Adding different functions was difficult so I had to do some research and watch some videos to make it work.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
-More practice and research.
